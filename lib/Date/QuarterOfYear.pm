=head1 NAME

Date::QuarterOfYear - calculate what quarter a given date is in

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Date::QuarterOfYear qw/ quarter_of_year /;

 $q = quarter_of_year('2013-02-17');        # '2013-Q1'
 $q = quarter_of_year($epoch);              # '2013-Q1'
 $q = quarter_of_year({ year => 2012, month => 8, day => 9 });

 ($year, $quarter) = quarter_of_year($epoch);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Date::QuarterOfYear provides a single function, C<quarter_of_year>,
which takes a date and returns what quarter that date is in.
The input date can be specified in various ways, and the result
will either be returned as a string of the form 'YYYY-QN' (eg '2014-Q2'),
or as a list C<($year, $quarter)>.

 $time             = time();
 $qstring          = quarter_of_year($time);
 ($year, $quarter) = quarter_of_year($time);

This is a very simple module, and there are other modules that can
calculate the quarter for you. But I have similar code in multiple places
where I don't want to load L<DateTime> just for this.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<DateTime> has several features related to quarters:
given a C<DateTime> instance, the C<quarter> method returns a
number between 1 and 4.
The C<day_of_quarter> method returns a number between 1 and the number
of days in the quarter.
The C<quarter_name> method returns a locale-specific name for the quarter.

L<Date::Format> provides a C<time2str> function that will generate
the quarter number (1..4).

L<Time::Moment> also provides a C<quarter> method that returns the
quarter number for a given date.
